	<!--	This extension point allows the user to contribute samples to the "samples" pane.
			 * The PNG image (16x16) is the image to display next to the library name.
			 * The "samples" directory is the root directory under which all samples live (note, no nesting of samples).
			 * The "infoFile" is an HTML index file which can be used to provide additional information about the samples.
			 * The preview handler can be left alone...that indicates we've created a special class that
				allows the user to preview a HTML sample without needing to import it as a project.

			The "includePath" sub element allows us to copy common code into a project when creating or previewing the sample,
			thus preventing use from needing to include the library in every sample.
