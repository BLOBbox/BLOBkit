BLOBkit from the BLOBforge - Be part of the TV 3.0 Revolution!

BLOBkit is a powerfull toolkit that enables web developers to easly deploy TV Portals and web applications for the TV screen.

It is composed by a Javascript library and a series of auxiliary resources: samples, templates, snippets and much more.

BLOBkit offers standard AJAX functionalities, like Connection Manager, Custom Event Handler, JSON Utilities, all of them redesigned for consumer electronics devices, with few CPU cycles, low computation capabilities and particular needs. Among them, there is a complete layer of hardware controllers for the BLOBbox's Podcast Aggregator, the Multimedia Player, the Remote Control and low level system tools.

Users of the BLOBbox WEBDEV Edition can work on their applications using BLOBkit's Log extensions and the Profiler System.

But BLOBkit is more than this. It is a collection of widgets and tools that fit perfectly in TV applications.
